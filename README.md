# CPython
Cython is a C++ interpreter, written in Python. It supports a subset of features of the C++11 standard, producing the output of a given piece of (C++) code.

Cython provides the following functionality:

1. Variable declaration, assignment and access
2. Evaluation of expressions
3. Array declaration, initialization and access
4. Conditional Statements
5. For Loops
6. Standard Output
7. Recursion
8. Class declaration
9. Object Creation and member variable access

The following error types are handled:

* Mismatch of data type and variable
* Redeclaration of existing variable
* Accessing out of range array index
* Variable out of scope

## Requirements
* Python3
* Python-ply

## How to Run
					python interpreter.py <test_file_name>.cpp
A sample test file, named "testcase.cpp" is also included in the repository.
